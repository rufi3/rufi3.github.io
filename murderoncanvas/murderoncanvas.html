    <div class="main-text">
      <p>You take on the role of a Slovenian private detective named Vanja Petelin, who is invited for a weekend in a studio in the woods owned by their acquaintance, a rising painter Jennifer Perks. The house can only be reached by train, since there are no roads in this protected national park. As you arrive, you realise that you are one of six guests, and none of you can leave before  Monday, when the next train leaves. It wouldn't be a problem if you weren't welcomed by some strange news: Jennifer insists that she didn't send the invitations and that somebody must have played a prank on her. Nonetheless, you're obliged to stay and see the weekend through. And just like every time you take a little trip, you prove once again that you're a magnet for crime. The evening starts with The sudden death of your unwilling hostess.</p>

      <p>You will be given five envelopes, one for each suspect. In each envelope, you will find some evidence that you collect from the suspect, as well as a booklet that provides their answers to every possible question you can ask them. Every envelope also contains a puzzle whose solution you should enter in the corresponding input field on the game website. During the game, you will be asked to search the crime scene and collect more evidence that should help you find the culprit. Investigate, question suspects, find evidence, solve puzzles, and finally, bring the murderer to justice!</p>
