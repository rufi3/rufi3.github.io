      <p>Jennifer Perks was a rising artist with a bright future ahead of her, a husband who adored her, and a new exhibition that was on its way to becoming a hit. She had it all. But even that wasn't enough.<br><br>Painting wasn't the only thing Jennifer had a talent for. She was also a passionate puzzle maker, and she loved to leave spicy messages hidden in her art, often revealing secrets about her friends and acquaintances, and complicating their lives this way. She was self-centered and not considerate of other people's feelings. It doesn't come as a surprise that she made a few enemies along the way.<br><br>Amy Graham, the owner of the gallery that was about to exhibit Jennifer's work for the second time, considered herself to be one of Jennifer's closest friends, despite all of her flaws. Nonetheless, one thing bothered her. She was madly in love with Simon Knight, Jennifer's husband.<br><br>Simon was everything Jennifer wasn't: a friendly veterinarian whose greatest joy was making people (and animals) around him happy. He spent most of his free time volunteering at the local dog shelter, and the rest of it he spent in planning romantic surprises for Jennifer. He was the man of Amy's dreams. However, out of respect for Jennifer, she never acted on her feelings, or at least until a certain event took place.<br><br>Amy wanted to get a couple of photos from a world-renowned photographer Ryan Flynn to show them in her gallery. Jennifer once told her that she was close with Ryan at the university and that they lost touch afterwards. Amy asked Jennifer if she could contact Ryan and put in a good word for her. And it worked! The day that Ryan brought his photos to the gallery, Jennifer left a letter for him and asked Amy to pass it on to him. Amy knew of Jennifer's passion for hidden messages and made a copy of the letter. When she managed to decode it, she was in shock. Not only had Jennifer never appreciated her husband as she should have, now she was planning on cheating on him! Soon after, Amy realised that Jennifer had started an affair with Ryan, as they didn't put much effort into hiding it.<br><br>That was too much for Amy to accept. She anonimously sent the copy of the letter to Simon, hoping that it would convince him to leave Jennifer. As nothing happened, she wasn't sure if he didn't find the hidden message or if he simply ignored the facts. That's when she decided Jennifer had to die.<br><br>Amy knew that Jennifer was planning to work in her studio the weekend after her exhibition opening and made a plan. She sent invitations with a false signature from Jennifer to all the people she knew had a reason to get rid of her. The list included Ryan Flynn, since she found out that Jennifer recently dumped him after he fell in love with her. Kylie Jordi, Ryan Flynn's half-sister, was also invited, since she was having money problems and she was asking Amy about the value of artist's work after their death. She knew Kylie was in possession of one of Jennifer's paintings, so Jennifer's death would certainly benefit her. And last but not least, Marvin Thorpe received the invitation. It was the art critic who suddenly gave Jennifer a raging review after tearing her apart a few months earlier. It took just a little snooping on his social media to find out about Jennifer blackmailing him after she found out about his fake followers. Amy also invited the famous Slovenian detective, Vanja Petelin, just for fun. She was so proud of her plan that she wanted to make it an even bigger challenge by bringing a private eye to the scene. The only thing that Amy didn't plan was Simon, who showed up in another attempt to surprise his beloved wife. She didn't want him to become a potential suspect, but there was nothing she could do about it.<br><br>The murder weapon was simple: Amy knew that Jennifer suffered from a severe milk allergy. There was never any cow's milk in Jennifer's home; she used almond milk instead. Amy simply decided to pour some cow's milk into the almond milk carton and let time do the rest. She also planned to take the adrenalin shot from Jennifer's bag and plant it in Kylie's suitcase, to put Kylie at the top of the suspects' list.<br><br>The latter was fairly simply done. However, exchanging the milk proved to be more complicated than she was hoping it would be, as it was hard to find a moment where the kitchen was empty. When the party arrived at 3:45 p.m., everybody gathered in the kitchen. Amy took the opportunity while going out for a cigarette to put duct tape over the strike plate of the terrace door to keep it from locking. Around 5 p.m., Kylie decided to do a whole photoshoot in the kitchen. At this time, she also had a coffee with almond milk and let everybody know how disgusting she found it. This made it clear that there was still almond milk in the carton.<br><br>Afterwards, detective Vanja Petelin decided to make dinner for the group. Vanja left the kitchen only once, at 6:05 p.m., to go to the toilet. This was a chance for Amy to put her plan into motion. She said she was going out for a smoke and left Jennifer, Simon, and Ryan in the living room. At the same moment, Kylie was going upstairs to try and steal some of Jennifer's paintings. She had to give up on the idea when she saw Marvin in the studio, making a selfie, and posting it on Social Soup.<br><br>Instead of smoking, Amy entered the kitchen through the terrace door and switched the milk in the carton. She heard Vanja's steps approaching the kitchen, and she had to act fast. She left the bottle on the kitchen counter, knowing that it could incriminate anyone. She wanted to remove the duct tape from the strike plate, but it wasn't there! She realised it must have fallen off somewhere, but there was no time to search for it. She quickly left the kitchen through the terrace door and returned to the living room before Vanja entered.<br><br>After dinner, around 7 p.m., Simon decided to make White Russians for the group to bring up the atmosphere. He used the milk to make the cocktail, not knowing what he was doing to his beloved wife. As soon as Jennifer drank some of it, she fell into anaphylaxis shock, and her adrenaline shot was nowhere to be found. This was the tragic end of the talented, yet arrogant, young woman.</p>
